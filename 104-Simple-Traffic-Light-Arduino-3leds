In this tutorial we are going to create a project to simulate a traffic light using arduino UNO R3 where the system will change from red to green, via amber and repeat this process again and again

PINS USED: 13, 12, 11

int redled = 13;
int yellowled = 12;
int greenled = 11;

void setup() {
  pinMode (13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (11, OUTPUT);
  
}

void loop() {

 digitalWrite (redled, 1);
 delay(9000);
    digitalWrite (redled, 0); //stopped  
      digitalWrite (yellowled, 1); 
   delay (3000); // yellowled lights for 3 sec.
   digitalWrite (yellowled, 0);
    digitalWrite (greenled, 1);
   delay (9000);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 0);// greenled start flashing
   delay (500);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 1);
   delay (500);    
   digitalWrite (greenled, 0);
   delay (500);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 1);
   delay (500);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 0);
  delay (500);
 digitalWrite (greenled, 1);
   delay (500);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 0);
     delay (500);
 digitalWrite (greenled, 1);
   delay (500);
   digitalWrite (greenled, 0);
